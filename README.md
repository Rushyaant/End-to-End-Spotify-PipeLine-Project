# End-to-End-Spotify-PipeLine-Project
The Spotify Data Pipeline automates extracting data from Spotify, transforming it, and loading it into Snowflake for analysis. AWS Lambda extracts and stores data in S3, AWS Glue processes and transforms it, and Snowflake loads it for querying. This ensures efficient, timely, and accurate data processing for seamless insights.
