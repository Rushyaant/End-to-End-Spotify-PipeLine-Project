# End-to-End-Spotify-PipeLine-Project
The Spotify Data Pipeline automates extracting data from Spotify, transforming it, and loading it into Snowflake for analysis. AWS Lambda extracts and stores data in S3, AWS Glue processes and transforms it, and Snowflake loads it for querying. This ensures efficient, timely, and accurate data processing for seamless insights.



Project Overview:
The Spotify Data Pipeline project aims to automate the process of extracting data from Spotify, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into Snowflake for analysis. The pipeline leverages AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, and Snowflake to manage data flow and transformation efficiently.

Key Components:
AWS Lambda Function:

Purpose: To extract raw data from Spotify and store it in an S3 bucket.
Steps:
Uses spotipy to interact with the Spotify API.
Extracts playlist data and stores it as a JSON file in an S3 bucket.
Triggers an AWS Glue job to process the extracted data.
AWS Glue Job:

Purpose: To transform the raw Spotify data and store the transformed data back into S3.
Steps:
Reads JSON data from S3.
Processes the data to extract relevant details about albums, artists, and songs.
Writes the transformed data back to S3 in CSV format.
Snowflake:

Purpose: To load the transformed data into Snowflake tables for querying and analysis.
Steps:
Creates tables for albums, artists, and songs.
Loads data into these tables using the transformed CSV files from S3.
Sets up Snowpipe to automate data loading.
Summary:
This project showcases a comprehensive data pipeline that efficiently extracts Spotify data, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into Snowflake for further analysis. By automating these steps, the pipeline ensures timely and accurate data processing, enabling users to derive insights from Spotify data seamlessly.
